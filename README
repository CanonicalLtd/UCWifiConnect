Prototype (terminal) Proces
--------------------------

Works on pi3 with TP-LINK 150Mbpx Wireless N Nano USB Adapter Model TL-WN725N

# Install snaps
snap install wifi-ap
snap install network-manager

also install wifi-connect (not in store yet

# Create content sharing dir for wifi-ap:control interfaces

sudo mkdir /var/snap/wifi-connect/common

(TODO: provide command for this. final solution will use interface hook script)

# Connect interfaces

snap connect wifi-connect:network-manager network-manager:service
snap connect wifi-connect:control wifi-ap:control

# Get terminal (ssh) connection to device over ethernet

# Display the ap config

$ sudo wifi-connect.wifi-ap -show

Note the wifi.address: 10.0.60.1. Use this later to ssh to device over the AP

(TODO: add support to configure the AP ip subnet and addr)

# Set the wifi AP SSID:

sudo wifi-connect.wifi-ap -ssid digit

# Set the AP passphrase:

sudo wifi-connect.wifi-ap -passphrase ubuntuubuntuubuntu

# Bring up the device AP:

sudo wifi-connect.wifi-ap -ap-on

# Close your ssh Ethernet connection and disconnect the device from Ethernet

# Join the device's new AP from your workstation

# ssh into the device over that AP using 10.0.60.1 

# Scan for, display, and connect to an APs (by ssid): (TODO: exclude the device hoseted AP)

knitzsche@localhost:~$ wifi-connect.connect 
Found SSIDs:
    astro_garden_2
    xfinitywifi
    Mywifi 
    digit
Connect to SSID: astro_garden_2
PW: xxxxxxxxxxx 

# Turn off the device AP:
 
(This breaks your current ssh over the AP)

sudo wifi-connect.wifi-ap -ap-off

ADDITIONAL
* display current wifi status on device with: nmcli d
* disconnect from a connected wifi with nmcli d disconnect INAME (for example nmcli d disconnect wlan1)
* turn on a rudimentary http server that scans for then displays APs (by ssids) with sudo wifi-connect.run (TODO, change that command name), then open its page with IP:8080 in a browser
